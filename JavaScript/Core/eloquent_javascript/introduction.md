# Introduction

I particularly liked the following sentense from the intro of the book:

> There are many terrible mistakes to make in program design, and you should go ahead and make them so that you understand them. A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules.

"List of rules" mentioned there is referring best practices. I think this is wise approach.
