# [Functional Light JS](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS)

As I'm big fan of [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) series, I was sure that Kyle Sympson's book about FP would be both fun and educating. This book's aim not to rigorously explain all the FP stuff, but is to teach how to use FP stuff in day to day JavaScript engineering.
