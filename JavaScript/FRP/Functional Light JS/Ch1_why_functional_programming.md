# Chapter 1: Why Functional Programming?

## Confidence

Author implies that FP code (eventyally) becomes more readable: you can ensure that your program is doing well just by reading it's source, not by running test suite. That's not doing FP bug-proof, but usually bugs exist in more obvious places.

## Communication

FP code tends to be more readable and understandable. The principles of FP are well established and deeply studied.

Example: once you learn `map(...)`, you'll be almost instantly understand what it does in any program. But you have to read through every `for(...)` loop to actually get what it does. Thus FP frees us up to think about higher level of program logic.
