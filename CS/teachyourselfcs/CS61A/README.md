# [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/)

I've been following [fall 2019 version of the course](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa19/).

This course uses very convenient tool called `ok` grader. This is python program which runs tests against your code. You can use `ok` grader if you download it from course home page along with assignments and homeworks. I only commit code directly related to assignments.

You can check correctness of homework exercises solutions by visiting [`https://cs61a.org/hw/sol-hw01/`](https://cs61a.org/hw/sol-hw01/), note the homework number in the link â€“ just substitute the number for the one you need.
